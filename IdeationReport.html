<h2 id="crossword-social-club">Non-Profit Bakery</h2>



<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The basic idea is to make the delicacies of bakery available to people who cannot afford it.</p>
<p>We also provide help and support to people in need of the basic essential items.</p>
<p>We stand strong and united in our cause with the great people around.</p>



<h3 id="expected-list-of-features">Expected List of Features</h3>

<p>The site will most likely include the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Homepage</strong> with a presentation of the website, with links to the main areas.</li>
<li><strong>About</strong> This is where the story unfolds</li>
<li><strong>Product</strong> where you can see all the products.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram</strong> where you can see all the amazing delicacies in making.</li>
</ul>

<p>In so many ways we are making the baking cusines available to people around the city/local area.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>With the help of local volunteers weekly</strong> <br>
The boxes are packed and made available to people who gather for volunteering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bikers around the city</strong> <br>
The best way to reach the majority of road-side people who don't have the luxury of even basic food can get the taste of our baking in no time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Through local dwellers</strong> <br>
Local dewellers like Rickshaw wallas, society vegetable sellers(who go to different society building to sell vegetables on door step) and through other local businesses</p></li>
</ul>
